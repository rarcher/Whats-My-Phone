# What's My Phone Android App

A small Android app that displays the device's model and serial number. It is primarily intended as an aid for
technophobes, as they may not realize this information is available through the built-in settings menu. It also fills a
gap in the Google Play app store, as searching for the phases "What's my serial number?" and "What's my model number?"
did not display useful results prior to its creation.
